# 02 - Data Cleaning (Python + JSON)

This project demonstrates how to clean and preprocess a JSON dataset using Python.  
It is part of my Data Analysis learning projects series.

## Cleaning Steps
- Removed users with missing names  
- Removed duplicate friends for each user  
- Filtered out inactive users (no friends or liked pages)  
- Removed duplicate pages by unique ID  
- Exported cleaned dataset into `cleaned_data2.json`  

## Tech Stack
- Python  
- JSON  
- Jupyter Notebook
